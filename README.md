# Java-Person-Parser
# Person Information Parser

A simple Java program that parses a structured string of personal data, creates "Person" objects, and displays their information in a clean and readable format.
This project demonstrates basic Java programming skills such as string parsing, object-oriented design, and formatted output.

## Features

- **Parses structured text** containing names and places of birth.
- **Creates Person objects** to store and represent the parsed information.
- **Displays output** in a clean, readable format in the console.

## Example Output

Once you run the program, the output will display the parsed names and their corresponding places of birth:

 ex: "John Davidson  from Belgrade."
